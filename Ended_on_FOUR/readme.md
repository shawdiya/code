### Project: Ended ON FOUR
The **Ended ON FOUR** project is a creative Python program that plays with string lengths and their corresponding word forms. The program starts by asking the user to input a string and checks the length. It then converts the length of the string into its word form (up to 10) and continues this process recursively until the length of the word becomes **four**.

#### Key Features:
1. **Initial String Length Check**: The program calculates the length of the user's input and prints it in word form.
2. **Recursive Length Calculation**: The program repeatedly checks the length of the word form of each length until it reaches four.
3. **End Condition**: The program stops once it reaches the word "four," which has 4 characters, printing a message that "Everything Ended on FOUR."
